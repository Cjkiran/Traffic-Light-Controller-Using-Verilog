# Traffic-Light-Controller-Using-Verilog

# Introduction
* The purpose of this project is to design a methodology using Verilog to control the traffic with specified time delays
Traffic control is a challenging problem in many cities. This is due to the large number of vehicles and the high dynamics of the traffic system. Poor traffic systems are the big reason for accidents, time losses. In this method of approach, it will reduce the waiting time of the vehicles at traffic signals. The hardware design has been developed using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) programming.
# Objective:
* The objective of this project is to design a traffic light controller that mimics the behavior of a real-world traffic light system, with considerations for the timing of signal transitions and the coordination between different signals at an intersection.
* A traffic light system is an electronic device that assigns right of way at an intersection or crossing or street crossing by means of displaying the standard red, yellow and green colored indications. In addition, it also works in conjunction with pedestrian displays to assign pedestrian crossing right of way.

* A traffic light, also known as traffic signal, stop light, stop-and-go lights, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location in order to indicate when it is safe to drive, ride, or walk using a universal colour code. Nowadays,

* A red light meant traffic in all directions had to stop.
* A yellow light meant cross-town traffic would have to slow and,
* A green light would to go or proceed
   The problem of heavy jam is happened because of never configure the level of jam in each way and set the delay time. Another problem represents when there is no jam, but the waiting still 
   continues. The solution for these problems is to determine the level of jam and set the delay time. This problem need of evaluation of the traffic policeman, and then there is need for manual 
   control of the traffic. The target of this paper is to propose system provide solution for all above problems with least possible cost. Traffic light controller (TLC) can be implemented using 
   microcontroller, FPGA, and ASIC design. FPGA has many advantages over microcontroller, some of these advantages are; the speed, number of input/output ports and performance which are all very 
   important in TLC design, at the same time ASIC design is more expensive than FPGA. Nowadays, FPGA becomes one of the most successful of todayâ€™s technologies for developing the systems which 
   require a real time operation. FPGA is a re-configurable integrated circuit that consists of two dimensional arrays of logic blocks and flip-flops with an electrically programmable 
   interconnection between logic blocks. The reconfiguration property enables fast prototyping and updates for hardware devices even after market launch. Most of the TLCs implemented on FPGA        are simple ones that have been implemented as examples of Finite State Machine (FSM).

   The Verilog language has been selected for programming the FPGA to fill two important needs in the design process.
   Firstly, it gives full description of the structure of a design that is how it is decomposed into sub-designs, and how those sub-designs are interconnected.
   Secondly, it allows simulating the design before starting the manufacturing.
   Accordingly, the designers can quickly compare alternatives and test for correctness without the delay and expense of hardware prototyping.
   Benefits of Using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) :
   Verilog is a widely used Hardware Description Language (HDL) for designing digital circuits. It can also be used for modeling analog circuits. Verilog is a descriptive language that describes 
   relationship between signals in a circuit.
 
  # Advantages using Verilog HDL are shown below :
  *  Easy to write.
  *  Easy to understand as it similar to C program.
  *  Easier to learn compared with VHDL.

  * Green light indicates that there is no traffic and there is easy flow of vehicles in that route/direction.
  * Red light indicates that there is a traffic jam and that route is blocked for the vehicles to move and,
  * Yellow light indicates that the route has medium flow of vehicles.
